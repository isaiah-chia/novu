# Authoring Conventions

House style for `<SYSTEM_NAME>` Structurizr DSL workspaces. Derived from
`01-<system>/workspace.dsl` — that file is the reference; when in doubt, match it. For
language syntax see [`SYNTAX.md`](SYNTAX.md); for domain terms see
[`GLOSSARY.md`](GLOSSARY.md).

---

## C4 leveling

- **L1** — people (actors) and software systems. `<SYSTEM_NAME>` is the single
  **in-focus** `softwareSystem`; everything else (external integrations — other systems,
  vendors, government services, authentication providers…) is an external system.
- **L2** — `container`s inside `<SYSTEM_NAME>` (e.g. database, web UI, batch pipelines,
  message-queue daemons…).
- **L3** — `component`s inside a container (e.g. DB tables, UI forms, stored procedures,
  handler classes…).

Do not model L4 (code). Stop at component level.

## Identifiers

- `!identifiers hierarchical` is set at the top of `model`.
- Identifiers are **snake_case**: `<actor_role>`, `<batch_pipeline>`, `<entity_table>`.
- Reference nested elements by **full path**: `<system>_db.<table>`,
  `<system>_web_ui.<screen>`.

```
db = container "Oracle Database" "..." "Oracle" {
    tb_person = component "TB_PERSON" "Person master ..."
}
...
<system>_<listener>.mq_daemon -> <system>_db.tb_person "Person upsert from <message-type>"
```

## Module grouping

The in-focus system is organised into a small set of `group`s, and every
container/component belongs to one. The conventional shape is:

| Group | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `Shared Platform` | Touched by every module (e.g. the database, the web UI). |
| `<Module-1>` | One business domain / journey. |
| `<Module-2>` | Another business domain / journey. |
| `...` | ... |

Inside shared containers (the database, the web UI), components are **sub-grouped by the
owning module** (`group "<Module-1>"`, `group "<Module-2>"`, …), plus the conventional
cross-cutting sub-groups:

- `group "<Master-Data>"` — entities shared by all modules (e.g. person, account, master
  records).
- `group "Cross-Journey State"` — tables written/read by 2+ modules.
- `group "<Domain-API>"` — a stored-procedure / function API surface, when one exists.

Pick group names that match the actual modules in `<SYSTEM_NAME>` — these names become
the diagram's primary navigation, so they should read like the business does.

## Naming

Keep real-world artifact names **verbatim** so the map traces back to source. The
identifier (snake_case) and display name can differ — the display name carries the real
artifact name, the identifier is a short handle:

```
tb_person = component "TB_PERSON" "..."
```

Document the prefix scheme of the system you're modelling. The shape below is an example
for an Oracle / PL/SQL / shell-batch stack; replace with the actual prefixes used by
`<SYSTEM_NAME>`:

| Artifact | Convention | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Database table | `TB_*` (component name) | `TB_PRACTICAL_BOOKING` |
| Stored function | `FN_*` | `FN_CHECK_ELIGIBILITY` |
| Stored procedure | `PR_*` / package `PKG_*` | `PR_GenSuspension`, `PKG_PRINTCO.pr_extract*` |
| Batch / shell job | real filename **+ cron time** | `ds_extract.sh (03:00)` |
| UI screen / handler | real filename / class.method | `PersonDetails.jsp`, `BookingCommand.reinstateBooking` |

## Description length budget

A component/container/relationship `description` string is its **label on the diagram**,
not a place for prose. The budget is fixed:

- **One line, ≤ ~120 characters.** That is roughly what fits on one row of a rendered
  box at the default width. If it wraps to a third line on the diagram, it's too long.
- **Shape of that one line:** *purpose* → *rough scale* → *key classes*. Example:
  `"Admin maintenance of lookup tables. 4 screens / 7 actions. CodeAction + CodeMgmtCommand + CodeMgmtDAO."`
- **Relationship descriptions** get the same budget: *what flows* + *cadence/trigger*,
  with the mechanism in the technology slot (see
  [Relationship descriptions](#relationship-descriptions)).
- The moment you reach for a second sentence, a table, a list, or a provenance paragraph
  — **stop and move it to a `!docs` page.** The inline string then shrinks back to the
  one-line summary.

This budget is a hard rule, not a guideline: the diagram is unreadable if boxes carry
paragraphs.

**Content by level** — the budget is the same one line; the higher the C4 level, the
more semantic and the less precise the label. Precision isn't deleted when you move up a
level; it lives lower down.

- **L1** (people, software systems): business role + read/write direction + the
  *headline* mechanism word (`MQ`, `SFTP`, `LDAP`). No queue names, IDs, byte layouts,
  file paths, hostnames, or QoS — but **do keep business cadence + time-of-day** (how
  often / when a flow runs reads as plain English and matters at any level). It
  shouldn't matter at L1 that an external speaks *binary* — only that it's a read-only
  consumer of `<SYSTEM>` state.
- **L2** (containers): purpose + technology + rough scope/role. No full table/queue
  enumerations or filesystem paths.
- **L3** (components): the precision tier — may name key classes / tables / the one
  defining queue or ID, still one line ≤ ~120 chars.
- **Relationships**: *what flows* + *cadence/trigger*, mechanism in the technology slot;
  at most one identifying token (e.g. a single queue name) and only when it is the
  clearest label.

**No detail lost on trim.** Before deleting a token from a box or arrow, confirm it
still lives at a lower level or in a `#` comment. If the box/arrow is its *only* home,
relocate it down — don't delete.

## Attached docs (`!docs`) — page shape

When detail exceeds the one-line budget, attach a Markdown file with `!docs`:

```
code_mgmt_ui = component "Code Administration UI" "Admin maintenance of lookup tables. 4 screens / 7 actions." {
    !docs ../docs/code-admin-ui.md
}
```

- One file per component/cluster, at `<folder>/docs/<kebab-name>.md`, kebab-named to
  match the cluster (`code-admin-ui.md`, `<feature>-ui.md`).
- **Canonical page shape** — pick a section set that fits the stack you're modelling and
  apply it *consistently* across sibling components. The example below fits a
  Java / server-rendered-UI / DAO stack; adjust the section names but keep the order
  *intro → UI surfaces → request handlers → business code → persistence behaviour →
  provenance*:

  ```markdown
  # <Cluster display name>          ← matches the component's display name

  <one-paragraph intro>            ← purpose · what distinguishes it from sibling clusters ·
                                      who drives it · the config file that wires it.
                                      Cross-link siblings with [[wikilinks]].

  ## UI surfaces                   ← table: | Surface | Purpose |
  ## Action mappings (N)           ← put the count N in the heading; table: | Action | Handler | Notes |
  ## Business classes              ← Controller / Service / DAO bullets, list DAO methods
  ## DB write behaviour            ← which tables, UPSERT vs insert, special keys/sanitisation
  ## Provenance notes              ← every [?] / NOT FOUND claim, with its reasoning
  ```

  Keep this **section order**; omit a section only when it genuinely doesn't apply. The
  intro is prose; everything under a `##` is tabular/bulleted, not paragraphs.

- **Overview / pass docs** (e.g. `database-triggers-overview.md`) are the exception:
  they drop the per-component sections and instead carry `## Modelling decisions`,
  `## Open items` (linking `[[verification#…]]`), and `## Files touched`. Use this shape
  for a cross-cutting source-read pass, not for a single component cluster.

## Cross-references (Obsidian wikilinks)

If docs are round-tripped through an Obsidian vault (a common workflow when the maps are
ingested from notes), links use Obsidian `[[Note]]` / `[[Note#Heading]]` syntax,
**not** relative Markdown paths — keep the wikilink form so the round-trip stays clean.

- In-repo targets resolve to sibling docs: `[[<feature>-ui]]`,
  `[[trigger-<table>-history]]`, `[[GLOSSARY]]`.
- External-vault targets are notes that live only in Obsidian — e.g. the verification
  log (`[[verification#V19]]`), an `[[Entry Point Catalog]]`, journey-flow notes. These
  won't open from the repo; that's expected. Don't delete or rewrite them into paths.

If you're not using a vault round-trip, switch to plain relative Markdown links — but
pick one form and stay consistent across the repo.

## Tags & styles

Tags drive the `styles` block. Use the existing taxonomy; don't invent new tags without
adding a matching style.

**Colour scheme:** soft/pastel — light fills + saturated coloured strokes + tinted dark
text (no solid fills).

| Element | Tag | Colour | Shape |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Person | `Person` | soft yellow (fill `#fff2cc`, stroke `#d6b656`) | person |
| `<SYSTEM>` (in-focus system) | `Software System` | soft blue (fill `#dae8fc`, stroke `#6c8ebf`) | rounded box |
| Container (default) | `Container` | soft blue (fill `#dae8fc`, stroke `#6c8ebf`) | rounded box |
| Database container | `Database` | soft blue (container fill) | cylinder |
| Filesystem container | `Filesystem` | soft blue (container fill) | folder |
| Component | `Component` | light blue (fill `#eef5fd`, stroke `#6c8ebf`) | component |
| External system | `External` | soft teal (mint fill `#e8f8f5`, turquoise stroke `#1abc9c`) | rounded box |
| Unknown / unconfirmed external | `External Unknown` | soft red + dashed border (fill `#fdecea`, stroke `#e74c3c`) — flags a gap | rounded box |

**Module colours** are applied to the **group boundary/label**, with containers staying
soft blue *inside* the coloured boundary. Assign one colour per business-module group,
plus a neutral one for `Shared Platform`:

| Module group | Colour |
| --- | --- |
| `Group:<Module-1>` | `<colour-1>` |
| `Group:<Module-2>` | `<colour-2>` |
| `Group:<Module-N>` | `<colour-N>` |
| `Group:Shared Platform` | grey |

> Person and a module group can share a colour by design — they are different element
> types (a coloured person shape vs. a coloured group outline), so they stay visually
> distinct.

Shapes come from the palette in [`SYNTAX.md`](SYNTAX.md) (`Cylinder`, `Folder`, `Bucket`,
`Pipe`, `Robot`, `WebBrowser`, …). Default C4 tags (`Element`, `Person`,
`Software System`, `Container`, `Component`, `Relationship`) are styled in the same
block — see `01-<system>/workspace.dsl` `styles { ... }`.

## Marker discipline (provenance — preserve these, never silently drop)

The map mixes confirmed-from-code facts with inferences. The markers encode trust level,
and the discipline around them is what makes the map trustworthy.

**The markers:**

- `[?]` in a name or description — **inferred / unconfirmed** element or relationship.
  Example: `manual_result_ui = component "Manual Result Entry UI [?]" "..."`.
- `"NOT FOUND in <SYSTEM> code"` / `"???"` in a description — a **known gap**; the
  integration is believed to exist but isn't evidenced in source. Tag the element
  `External Unknown` where applicable.

**Where each marker lives:**

- `[?]` attaches to the *smallest* uncertain unit — put it in the **name** when the
  whole element is speculative, in the **description** when only one claim is shaky
  (e.g. one action's write path).
- When detail moves to a `!docs` page, every marker moves with it into that page's
  `## Provenance notes` section, each with its reasoning — never lost in the migration.
- A `NOT FOUND` / `???` element should also carry the `External Unknown` tag so the gap
  is visible on the diagram, not just in text.

**Removing a marker is a verification claim.** Dropping a `[?]` asserts you checked the
fact against source. So only remove one when you've actually confirmed it, and **record
the confirmation** rather than just deleting the marker:

- Log the finding in the verification note and cite it from the doc —
  `see [[verification#V19]]`.
- If source-read *contradicts* a prior claim (not just confirms it), say so explicitly
  in the doc (a "Catalog claim vs Source reality" table is the model) and open a
  `[[verification#…]]` item. Don't quietly flip the text.

When in doubt, leave the marker in. An over-cautious `[?]` costs a re-check; a
wrongly-removed one silently launders a guess into a fact.

## Relationship descriptions

Relationships carry the real **mechanism** (in the technology slot) and the
**flow + cadence/trigger** (in the description). Write the description for an
**intelligent but non-expert reader** — someone who wants to know *what flows and how
often*, not the wire format.

**Shape: verb + noun, then frequency/time.** Lead with an action verb and the business
noun; append cadence and time-of-day when they exist.

```
courts -> <system>_<listener>.mq_daemon "Sends conviction + Form L PDF. Event-driven." "IBM MQ"
<system>_<batch>.sftp_out -> <vendor> "07:35: sends letters for printing." "SFTP"
<system>_<batch>.ds_elig -> <system>_db.fn_check_eligibility "Calls for today + tomorrow."
```

Prefer `"SFTP"`, `"IBM MQ"`, `"PL/SQL call"`, `"HTTP POST"`, `"File"`, `"Physical"` as
the technology slot.

**Keep:** the verb + business noun, frequency/cadence (`daily`, `7x/day`, `weekly Sat`),
time-of-day (`04:50`, `07:35`), and concrete user-meaningful facts (fees,
`up to 3 attempts`, SLAs, `sequentially dependent`).

**Drop the jargon noise:** filenames, hosts/IPs, queue names, MQ QoS (persistent /
priority / expiry), wire-format and protocol words (`RFH2`, `SSL/TCP`, `Base64`),
internal class / DAO / command names, and journey `Step-N` references. **Don't repeat
the technology slot** either — it already renders the mechanism on the arrow (`[SFTP]`,
`[IBM MQ]`, `[LDAP]`), so `"SFTP push ..." "SFTP"` is redundant.

**Don't lose provenance on a trim.** Before deleting a token, confirm it survives
elsewhere:
- Class / DAO / command names are usually already in the section's `#` block comment —
  they can simply be dropped from the arrow.
- A real artefact the arrow is the *only* home for (an SFTP host, a data filename, a
  cron script name, the one MQ QoS line) → **relocate it into a `#` comment** above the
  edge or section; don't delete it.
- Provenance markers (`[?]`, `NOT FOUND`, `not in code`) stay verbatim (see
  [Marker discipline](#marker-discipline-provenance--preserve-these-never-silently-drop)).

**This phrasing applies at every level — the level controls how much detail survives,
not the style** (see [Content by level](#description-length-budget)). L1 /
externally-facing edges are the leanest; L2 container edges add purpose + scope; **L3
component edges are the precision tier and may name the key table / class / one defining
queue or ID** — still one line, but a little more detail is acceptable when it earns its
place. The moment a relationship needs a second sentence or a list, move the detail to a
`!docs` page and shrink the arrow back to its one-line summary.

## Views

- Give **every view an explicit `[key]`** — auto-generated keys are not layout-stable.
- Use `autoLayout lr` to match existing diagrams (or whichever layout the reference
  workspace uses — pick one and stay consistent).
- Standard set per workspace: one `systemContext`, one `container`, and one `component`
  view per container worth drilling into.
- `dynamic` views are the tool for **user-journey workspaces**: list relationships in
  order rather than `include *`.
- **Dynamic-view step descriptions follow the same
  [verb+noun rule](#relationship-descriptions)** as static-view edges. The step is still
  a relationship; the `Step N: …` / `[Δ]` / `[<path-label>]` scaffolding is journey
  narrative, but the body is *verb + business noun + cadence/threshold* — drop tables,
  procs, classes, letter codes, tag codes, column flags, SQL fragments. Relocate any
  orphan artefact into a `#` comment above the view or the step (per
  [Relationship descriptions](#relationship-descriptions)).

## Tool-managed files

- `workspace.dsl` is the **source of truth** — edit this.
- `workspace.json` is **generated by Structurizr Lite** and stores manual layout — do
  not hand-edit.
- `.structurizr/` is gitignored runtime/index data.

## Modularization principles (for a future split)

When the reference workspace grows large enough to split, structure it so the split is
mechanical:

- **model / views / styles are separable** — they can become `model.dsl`, `views.dsl`,
  `styles.dsl` pulled in via `!include`.
- **Per-module blocks are comment-fenced** with `# =====` banners (e.g.
  `# <MODULE-1>`, `# <MODULE-2> RELATIONSHIPS`). These fences are the natural `!include`
  seams — each module's elements + relationships can move to its own fragment.
- Keep a single top-level `workspace.dsl` that `!include`s the fragments, so identifiers
  stay in one hierarchical namespace.
- `!include` makes a workspace non-portable (see `SYNTAX.md`); that's acceptable for a
  local-Lite repo.
